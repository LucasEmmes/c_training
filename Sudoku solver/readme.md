# Sudoku solver  
This is a basic sudoku solver made using recursion  
I plan on adding the ability to read sudoku's from a file  
so that I can measure it's speed against that of my (now working)  
python implementation, but I have other ideas for now.  

Fun fact: the first time I wrote this, I based it off an earlier solver I made  
in python, except it somehow turned out that one never worked ._.  
Well this one does, anyway.
